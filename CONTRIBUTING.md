## Reporting issues
- Search existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.
- When opening an issue include:
  - A clear title and description of the problem or feature request.
  - Environment information (OS, compiler version, any relevant dependency versions).
  - Steps to reproduce (minimum reproducible example if possible).
  - Expected vs actual behavior.
  - Logs or stack traces, and any input files needed to reproduce the issue.
  - If relevant, attach small test files or a short script that reproduces the problem.

## Proposing changes (pull requests)
- Fork the repository and create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name, e.g. `feature/add-xyz`, `fix/issue-123` or `docs/update-abc`.
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
- Rebase or merge the latest `main` into your branch to keep history clean and resolve conflicts locally.
- Open a pull request targeting `main`. In the PR description, include:
  - A short summary of the change and why it is needed.
  - Related issue number(s) (e.g. "Fixes #123").
  - Any design decisions or trade-offs.
  - How you tested the change and instructions to reproduce the test.

## Code style and tests
- Follow the project's existing style. If the repository contains a linter or style guide, run it before submitting.
- Add unit or integration tests for new features and bug fixes where applicable.
- If the project uses a code formatter (black, clang-format, etc.), run it before committing.
- Ensure all tests pass locally.

## Branching and commit messages
- Use short, descriptive branch names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` prefixes help reviewers.
- Commit message format:
  - One-line summary (50 characters or less).
  - Blank line.
  - More detailed description, if necessary (wrap at ~72 characters).
- Use present tense and imperative mood, with the first letter of the sentence capitalized, e.g. "Add command-line option for X".

## Pull request checklist
Before requesting review, ensure:
- [ ] The PR targets the `main` branch.
- [ ] Documentation (README, Doxygen comment blocks) is updated if relevant.
- [ ] The code is formatted and linted.
- [ ] Tests covering the change are added or updated.
- [ ] All CI checks pass.
- [ ] Descriptive PR title and body, with linked issues if any.

## Reviewing and maintaining
- Be responsive to review comments: update your branch, push changes, and add replies explaining choices.
- Keep PRs focused and small where possible — they review faster.
- Maintainers may ask to squash or rework commits before merging. Maintain a cooperative attitude.

## Communication and Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and courteous in issues and PRs. Constructive feedback helps everyone.
- If you are unsure about something, ask maintainers or contributors before implementing a large change.

## Getting help
- If you need assistance getting started, open an issue prefixed with `Help:` and maintainers or developers will try to help.
